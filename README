ws-tutorial

This is a tutorial for using WebSocket with Go programming language.

The document is in ServingWebSocketsinGo.html (and ServingWebSocketsinGo.odt
for ODT format).

The two steps of developing the tutorial are in directories 01-basic (basic
web page, not WebSocket) and 02-websocket (web page with WebSocket support
and echoserver.go for testing the application).
